## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Step 1 - Load libraries into coding environment
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org/"))

library("dplyr")
library("reshape2")
# Step 2 - Import data into coding environment
bdf <- read.csv("Intro Pt 5 Data.csv")

# Step 3 - Inspect data to ensure it was imported correctly
head(bdf)

# Step 4 - Get mean of the Mass column

bdf %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

# Step 5 - Utilize group_by function to combine all clades and calculate mean for all of them at once.

bdf %>%
  group_by(Clade)%>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

#Step 6 - Add an additional grouping (Median)

bdf %>%
  group_by(Clade)%>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE), Median = median(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

#Step 7 - Example for filter function

bdf %>%
  filter(Clade == "Ornithischia") %>%
  filter(Mass <= 5000)
