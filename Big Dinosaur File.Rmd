## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Step 1 - Load libraries into coding environment
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org/"))

library("dplyr")
library("reshape2")
# Step 2 - Import data into coding environment
bdf <- read.csv("Intro Pt 5 Data.csv")

# Step 3 - Inspect data to ensure it was imported correctly
head(bdf)

# Step 4 - Get mean of the Mass column

bdf %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

# Step 5 - Utilize group_by function to combine all clades and calculate mean for all of them at once.

bdf %>%
  group_by(Clade)%>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

#Step 6 - Add an additional grouping (Median)

bdf %>%
  group_by(Clade)%>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE), Median = median(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

#Step 7 - Example for filter function

bdf %>%
  filter(Clade == "Ornithischia") %>%
  filter(Mass <= 5000)

#Step 8 - Advanced filtering with Grepl (Search for a pattern match)

bdf1 <- bdf%>%
  filter(grepl("saurus", Taxon))

#Step 9 - More advanced filtering examples

bdf %>%
  filter(Clade != "Dinosauromorpha") %>%
  group_by(Clade, Subclade) %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE), Median = median(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

#Step 10 - Slice Example (Slice takes only the rows that meet that criteria, but does then according to the grouping function.)

bdf %>%
  filter(Clade != "Dinosauromorpha") %>%
  group_by(Clade, Subclade) %>%
  slice(which.max(Mass))

#Step 11 - Select function example (Takes only those columns and drops all others from the data frame.)

bdf %>%
  filter(Clade != "Dinosauromorpha") %>%
  group_by(Clade, Subclade) %>%
  slice(which.min(Mass)) %>%
  select(Clade, Subclade, Mass)

#Step 12 - Long to wide format using dcast function

#bdf1 <- bdf %>%
  #filter(Clade != "Dinosauromorpha") %>%
  #group_by(Clade, Subclade) %>%
  #summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE), Median = median(Mass, na.rm = TRUE))

#bdf2 <- dcast(bdf1, Subclade ~ Clade, value.var = "Mean")

#Step 13 - Recreate table example

bdf1 <- bdf %>%
  filter(Clade != "Dinosauromorpha") %>%
  group_by(Clade, Max_age) %>%
  summarize(Mean = mean(Mass, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  dcast(Max_age~Clade, value.var = "Mean")

#Step 14 - Import Data for time
read.csv("Time.csv")

#Step 15 - Use filter to make a dataset of only the Early/Late Times in the time sheet. Do they match the bdf sheet?
