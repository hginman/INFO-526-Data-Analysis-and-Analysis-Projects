## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Step 1 - Load libraries into coding environment

library("dplyr")
library("reshape2")
library("lubridate")
library("ggplot2")



```

```{r}
#Step 2 - Load cleaned UFO data into coding environment

UFO <- read.csv("UFO Clean.csv")

UFO$year <- year(as.Date(UFO$datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))

UFO
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
